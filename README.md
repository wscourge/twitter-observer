# Twitter Observer

A chrome extension that observes your 𝕏 feed and gives you some basic stats on
the posts you see.

![Example Metrics](https://github.com/wscourge/twitter-observer/blob/prd/public/example.png?raw=true)

Discover how many posts are :

1. written by people with 𝕏's **blue checkmark**,
2. contain **hashtags** inside their content,
3. contain **mentions** inside their content,
4. contain **external links** inside their content.

The idea is to help you write better tweets that reach more people. It is by no
means conclusive at this point, but it is also better than no data.

## Installation

Visit [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bcdeieojpmihbojahcilemhfafjmdgne) and install the extension.

## Contributing

I'm generally open to feature requests and PRs. Do the following:

1. Open an issue.
1. Wait for my response before commiting your time to PR.
1. Once I let you know I'll add it, go for it.

Thanks for taking an interest in it.

## License

[GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/wscourge/twitter-observer/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Privacy

All data (the stats) stay in YOUR browser.

In the future, I might create a service that lets you upload anonimized data, so
people can get the bigger picture.

It will be opt-in, and turned off by default.

## Development

It was generated by [guocaoyi/create-chrome-ext](https://github.com/guocaoyi/create-chrome-ext), the React template.

### Installing

1. Check if your `Node.js` version is >= **14**.
2. Change or configurate the name of your extension on `src/manifest`.
3. Run `bun install` to install the dependencies.

### Running it locally

run the command

```shell
$ cd twitter-observer

$ bun dev
```

#### Chrome Extension Developer Mode

1. set your Chrome browser 'Developer mode' up
2. click 'Load unpacked', and select `twitter-observer/build` folder

#### Nomal FrontEnd Developer Mode

1. access `http://0.0.0.0:3000/`
2. when debugging popup page, open `http://0.0.0.0:3000//popup.html`
3. when debugging options page, open `http://0.0.0.0:3000//options.html`

### Packing

After the development of your extension run the command

```shell
$ bun build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.
